# DMX Images

Handles image uploads, display image file topics in maps and in detail panel, as well as embeds video files (muted with controls). The latter two features should move into the `dmx-files` plugin. As long as they are not there, dmx-images takes care of that.

The plugin also adds a "Resize" command to all _Files_ of Media Type JPEG or PNG allowing users to easily create new, derived and resized versions of their graphic file.

For uploading image files this plugin relies and extends the [dmx-upload-dialog](https://github.com/mukil/dmx-upload-dialog). Image files are stored in a dedicated `images` directory of the resp. DMX Filerepo.
