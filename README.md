# DMX Images

Adds a "Resize" command to all _Files_ of Media Type JPEG or PNG allowing users to easily create new, derived and resized versions of their graphic file.

This plugin also extends the [dmx-upload-dialog](https://github.com/mukil/dmx-upload-dialog) for handling the upload of image files into a dedicated `images` directory of the DMX Filerepo.
